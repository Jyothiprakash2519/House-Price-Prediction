# House-Price-Prediction Using Linear Regression

-> Developed a machine learning model to predict house prices using features such as number of rooms, square footage, neighborhood, and building age.
-> Conducted data cleaning, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis on a real estate dataset with 1,460+ entries and 80+ features
-> Applied Linear Regression to model relationships between housing features and price, achieving an RMSE of ~52,000
-> Evaluated model using RÂ² Score and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
-> Visualized results with heatmaps, correlation matrices, and actual vs predicted price plots

Tools Used: Python, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
